# Autoencoder enabled global optimization
In this repository, the code and data used to generate the results from the paper "Fighting the curse of dimensionality: A machine learning approach to finding global optima" can be found. This should allow the reconstruction of the results visible in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6.
