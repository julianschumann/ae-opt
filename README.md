# Autoencoder enabled global optimization
In this repository, the code and data used to generate the results from the paper "Fighting the curse of dimensionality: A machine learning approach to finding global optima" can be found. This should allow the reconstruction of the results visible in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6.

Figure 2 shows the results of optimizing the benchmark functions. When reproducing the results fro c2, c3 and c4, it should be enough to just run the repsective python files benchmark_test_. But for c1, the program was run in parallel on the
